    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>
        Welcome to my About Me page! My name is Lucas Bustle, and I'm passionate about technology and innovation. 
        I have a demonstrated history of working in consulting and the higher education industry. 
        I am a Certified Professional Scrum Master with expertise in various areas such as server remediation, 
        CMMC, security auditing, solution architecture, data migration, cyber security, and communication.
    </p>

    <p>
        I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Information Technology focused on Cyber Security 
        from the University of Cincinnati. During my time there, I gained valuable skills and knowledge 
        that have helped me succeed in my career.
    </p>

    <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy learning new technologies and furthering my expertise. I'm currently 
        working towards obtaining additional certifications, such as the AWS Solutions Architect certification. 
        I'm also diving into software development and self-teaching myself Python, SQL, Linux, and Docker.
    </p>

    <p>
        Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out to me if you have any questions or opportunities 
        you'd like to discuss. I'm always excited to connect with fellow professionals and explore new 
        possibilities.
